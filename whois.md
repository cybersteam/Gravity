<h2>Who is Native Leap?</h2>


Ivan draws his song writing inspiration from an ever changing world, human advancement, social change and expression such as art, technology and culture. A lifestyle of nomadic habits and relations that mean the most. His guitar playing reflects these themes with a sometimes rough and raw percussive guitar complemented with a delicate finger-picking style.
Candice bring's her many years of classical training and musical structure and arrangement to the mix. Her piano skills are exemplary and her sensitive interpretation of harmony and rythm play a critical role in the creative mix.
