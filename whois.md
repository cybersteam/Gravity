<h2>Who is Native Leap?</h2>

The project was started by Ivan in 2012, after a brief period identifying as NowsWay. There have been many iterations since then and this is now the fully launched identity of Native Leap, officially named in 2017.
<br>
<br>
Candice Panthera and Ivan joined forces in 2014, pairing her sensitive technical style with his crypto songwriting, vocals and guitar work. After 6 months of adventure across South Africa, writing music along the way, the first Raw-Cut album "Borderlands" was recorded and released which included many of Ivan's older songs and new one's, travelborne.

<li>Roger Van Schie is our star Eukele player and also has a great rythm on the percussion amongst his many talents.</li>

<li>Big love to the amazing people who pre-ordered the last album and bought them when they came out, you rock!</li>
</ul>

Ivan draws his song writing inspiration from an ever changing world, human advancement, social change and expression. A lifestyle of nomadic habits and relations that mean the most. His guitar playing reflects these themes with a sometimes rough and raw percussive guitar complemented with a delicate finger-picking style.
Candice bring's her many years of classical training and musical structure to the mix. Her piano skills are exemplary and her sensitive interpretation of harmony and rythm play a critical role in the creative mix.
