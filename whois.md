<h2>Who is Native Leap?</h2>

The project was started by Ivan in 2012, after a brief period identifying as NowsWay. There have been many iterations since then and Native Leap is now the official identity, named in early 2017.
<br>
<br>
Candice Panthera and Ivan joined forces in 2014, pairing her sensitive technical style with his crypto abstract songwriting, vocals and guitar work. After 6 months of adventure across South Africa, writing music along the way, the first Raw-Cut album "Borderlands" was recorded and released in 2015 which included many of Ivan's older songs and new one's, travelborne.
<br>
<br>
Ivan draws his song writing inspiration from an ever changing world, human advancement, social change and expression such as art, technology and culture. A lifestyle of nomadic habits and relations that mean the most. His guitar playing reflects these themes with a sometimes rough and raw percussive guitar complemented with a delicate finger-picking style.
Candice bring's her many years of classical training and musical structure and arrangement to the mix. Her piano skills are exemplary and her sensitive interpretation of harmony and rythm play a critical role in the creative mix.
